      "answer": "Connectivity is a concept used to establish whether two pixels are connected based on their intensity values and their spatial relationship. It defines the set of neighbors that are considered linked to a central pixel $p$ at coordinates $(x, y)$.\n\n1.  **4-Connectivity (D-Connectivity):**\n    * A pixel $p$ is 4-connected to its neighbor $q$ if $q$ is in the set $N_4(p)$, which consists of the **horizontal and vertical neighbors** of $p$.\n    * The coordinates of the 4-neighbors are: $(x-1, y)$, $(x+1, y)$, $(x, y-1)$, and $(x, y+1)$.\n    * In 4-connectivity, only neighbors that share an **edge** with $p$ are considered connected.\n    \n\n2.  **8-Connectivity:**\n    * A pixel $p$ is 8-connected to its neighbor $q$ if $q$ is in the set $N_8(p)$, which consists of all $N_4(p)$ neighbors **plus the diagonal neighbors** of $p$.\n    * The coordinates of the 8-neighbors are all 8 pixels surrounding $p$: $(x \\pm 1, y)$, $(x, y \\pm 1)$, $(x \\pm 1, y \\pm 1)$, and $(x \\mp 1, y \\pm 1)$.\n    * In 8-connectivity, neighbors that share an **edge or a corner** with $p$ are considered connected.\n    ",

      "answer": "Digital image acquisition involves converting a continuous-toned optical image (analogue signal) into a discrete digital image through two main processes: **Sampling** and **Quantization**.\n\n## 💡 Sampling (Spatial Discretization)\n* **Definition:** The process of discretizing the **spatial coordinates** (the $x$ and $y$ axes) of the continuous image. It determines the **resolution** of the image.\n* **Procedure:** It involves taking intensity measurements at discrete, equally spaced locations across the image plane.\n* **Result:** The continuous image is converted into a grid of discrete picture elements, called **pixels**.\n* **Impact:** Determines the **size** of the image (number of rows and columns, $M \\times N$). Higher sampling rate means finer spatial detail and higher resolution.\n\n## 🎨 Quantization (Amplitude Discretization)\n* **Definition:** The process of discretizing the **amplitude** (intensity or gray level) values of the sampled image at each pixel location.\n* **Procedure:** The continuous range of intensity values is mapped to a finite set of discrete gray levels, typically $L=2^k$ levels, where $k$ is the number of bits.\n* **Result:** The intensity value of each pixel is assigned an integer value (gray level) from 0 to $L-1$.\n* **Impact:** Determines the **depth** of the image (number of gray levels). Higher quantization levels (more bits, $k$) mean better intensity resolution and fewer false contours.",

        "answer": "The **Alpha-Trimmed Mean Filter** (or **Averaging Filter**) is a non-linear smoothing filter used primarily to reduce **mixed noise** (like Gaussian and Impulse noise, e.g., salt-and-pepper) while preserving image detail better than a simple mean filter.\n\n## ⚙️ Functioning\n1.  For a given $m \\times n$ neighborhood (window), the filter first **sorts** the gray levels of all $mn$ pixels in ascending order.\n2.  A value $d$ (where $d$ is an even integer, typically $1 \\le d < mn$) is specified. The filter then **discards** $d/2$ of the smallest gray-level values and $d/2$ of the largest gray-level values from the sorted list. This process is called **trimming**.\n3.  The filter output for the central pixel is the **average (mean)** of the remaining $mn - d$ pixel values.\n\n## 📝 Mathematical Formula\nLet $S_{xy}$ be the set of pixel values in the neighborhood. Let $S'_{xy}$ be the sorted set of values. The $\\alpha$-trimmed mean $g(x, y)$ is calculated as:\n$$g(x, y) = \\\\frac{1}{mn - d} \\\\sum_{(r, c) \\\\in S'_{xy}} I(r, c)$$ where the sum excludes the $d$ trimmed values.\n\n## 📌 Example\nConsider a $3 \\times 3$ neighborhood with pixel values: $\\\\{10, 20, 30, 100, 50, 60, 250, 70, 80\\\\}$. The window size is $mn=9$.\n\n* **Filter Goal:** Use an $\\\\alpha$-trimmed mean filter with $d=4$.\n* **Step 1: Sort the values:** $S'_{xy} = \\\\{10, 20, 30, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100, 250\\\\}$\n* **Step 2: Trim $d=4$ values:** Discard $d/2 = 2$ smallest (10, 20) and $d/2 = 2$ largest (100, 250).\n* **Remaining values:** $\\\\{30, 50, 60, 70, 80\\\\}$.

This indicates a lack of bright details and overall low illumination.\n    \n\n2.  **Bright Image:** The histogram is concentrated towards the **high-intensity** (bright) side (right side, closer to $L-1$). This indicates an image with over-exposure or predominantly bright objects.\n    \n\n3.  **Low Contrast Image:** The histogram is **narrow and concentrated** in the middle of the gray scale. This indicates that the image pixels use only a small range of gray levels, resulting in poor differentiation between objects and a 'washed-out' or dull appearance.\n    \n\n4.  **High Contrast Image:** The histogram is **spread out** over the entire gray scale, with peaks typically at the low and high extremes (bi-modal distribution). This indicates that the image contains both very dark and very bright areas, utilizing the full dynamic range for a sharp, detailed appearance.\n    ",

This region is tested. If it's non-homogeneous, it is divided into four sub-regions. Each sub-region is then tested recursively until all sub-regions are homogeneous or the regions become single pixels.\n* **Data Structure:** This recursive division naturally forms a **Quadtree**, where the root node is the entire image, and the leaf nodes are the homogeneous regions (or pixels).\n\n## 2. 🤝 Region Merging\n* **Principle:** After splitting, two adjacent regions $R_i$ and $R_j$ that **are individually homogeneous** might actually be part of the same larger, meaningful object. If the union of these two adjacent, homogeneous regions **also satisfies** the homogeneity criterion (e.g., $P(R_i \\cup R_j) = \\text{TRUE}$), they are **merged** to form a single larger region.\n* **Process:** Merging is performed to prevent over-segmentation (too many small regions) caused by the splitting step. The process is iteratively applied to neighboring regions (quadtree nodes at the same level) until no two adjacent regions can be merged without violating the homogeneity criterion.\n\n## 🔁 Complete Algorithm\n1.  **Split:** Start with the whole image. Recursively split any non-homogeneous region into four quadrants.\n2.  **Merge:** After splitting, merge any two adjacent regions that are both homogeneous and whose union is also homogeneous.\n3.  **Stop:** The process stops when no further splitting or merging is possible.",

The transition from 0 to 1 is smooth, which is determined by the filter order $n$.\n    * A **low order $n$** results in a very smooth transition, minimizing **ringing artifacts** (ripples) in the spatial domain.\n    * A **high order $n$** approaches the shape of an Ideal filter, but increases the ringing effect.\n3.  **Cutoff Frequency $\\mathbf{D_0}$:** This is the distance from the origin at which the filter's gain is $H(u, v) = 0.5$.

The noise is characterized by abrupt, large changes in intensity. The most effective way to handle this noise is by using **Order-Statistic (Non-linear) Filters**, primarily the **Median Filter**.\n\n## 🛡️ Median Filter (The Primary Solution)\n\n1.  **Mechanism:** The Median Filter is an order-statistic filter that replaces the gray level of a central pixel with the **median** of the gray levels in its neighborhood (e.g., $3 \\times 3$ window).\n2.  **Process:**\n    * The filter window is centered at the pixel $(x, y)$.\n    * All pixel values in the window are collected and **sorted** in ascending order.\n    * The **middle value** of the sorted list is selected as the new gray level for the central pixel.\n3.  **Effectiveness:** Since salt-and-pepper noise introduces very low (black, near 0) and very high (white, near $L-1$) values, these noisy pixels will be at the **extremes** of the sorted list. By selecting the median, the noisy values are effectively **discarded** and replaced by a more representative value from the surrounding non-noisy pixels. The median filter is excellent at preserving edges while removing impulse noise.\n\n## 🥈 Other Solutions (For Reference)\n* **Max/Min Filter:** Max filter removes 'pepper' noise (low values), and Min filter removes 'salt' noise (high values), but they are less effective than the Median filter as a general solution.\n* **Alpha-Trimmed Mean Filter:** Can also be used for mixed noise, but the Median filter ($d = mn-1$) is a specific and optimal case for pure salt-and-pepper noise.",

      "answer": "The **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** is a mathematical tool that decomposes an image (spatial domain) into its constituent frequency components (frequency domain). It is fundamental for image filtering and analysis in the frequency domain. Key properties of the 2-D DFT $F(u, v)$ of an image $f(x, y)$ are:\n\n1.  **Separability:** The 2-D DFT can be computed by applying the 1-D DFT sequentially along the rows and then along the columns (or vice-versa). This makes computation more efficient, especially with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\n    $$F(u, v) = \\sum_{x=0}^{M-1} \\left[ \\sum_{y=0}^{N-1} f(x, y) e^{-j2\\pi vy/N} \\right] e^{-j2\\pi ux/M}$$\n\n2.  **Shifting (Translation):**\n    * **Spatial Domain Shift:** Shifting the image $f(x, y)$ by $(x_0, y_0)$ in the spatial domain introduces a phase shift in the frequency domain, but the magnitude spectrum remains unchanged. This means the spectral content is independent of the image's location.\n    $$\\mathcal{F}\\{f(x-x_0, y-y_0)\\} = F(u, v) e^{-j2\\pi (ux_0/M + vy_0/N)}$$\n    * **Frequency Domain Shift (Centering):** Multiplying the image by $(-1)^{x+y}$ shifts the center of the frequency spectrum to the origin of the frequency plane (DC component at $F(0, 0)$ to $F(M/2, N/2)$). This is crucial for visualization and filter design.\n    $$\\mathcal{F}\\{f(x, y) (-1)^{x+y}\\} = F(u-M/2, v-N/2)$$\n\n3.  **Periodicity:** The DFT and its inverse are infinite, periodic functions. For an $M \\times N$ image, $F(u, v)$ is periodic with period $M$ in the $u$ direction and $N$ in the $v$ direction.\n    $$F(u, v) = F(u+M, v) = F(u, v+N)$$\n\n4.  **Conjugate Symmetry:** If the image $f(x, y)$ is a real function (which is true for grayscale images), its DFT exhibits conjugate symmetry, meaning the magnitude spectrum is symmetric about the origin.\n    $$F(u, v) = F^*(-u, -v) \\implies |F(u, v)| = |F(-u, -v)|$$\n\n5.  **Linearity:** The DFT is a linear transform. The DFT of a linear combination of two functions is the same linear combination of their individual DFTs.\n    $$\\mathcal{F}\\{a f(x, y) + b g(x, y)\\} = a F(u, v) + b G(u, v)$$\n\n6.  **Rotation (Geometric):** Rotating the image $f(x, y)$ by an angle $\\theta$ in the spatial domain results in the same rotation of the DFT $F(u, v)$ in the frequency domain. Rotation in one domain corresponds to rotation in the other.",

It is generally superior to Huffman coding because it can achieve compression rates arbitrarily close to the theoretical entropy limit.\n\n1.  **Principle:** Instead of assigning a fixed-length or integer-length codeword to each symbol (like Huffman), Arithmetic coding assigns a **range of values** to each symbol based on its probability. The size of the range is proportional to the symbol's probability.\n2.  **Process:**\n    * The encoding process starts with the current range being $[0, 1)$.\n    * For each new symbol, the current range is divided into sub-intervals based on the cumulative probability of the symbols.\n    * The sub-interval corresponding to the current symbol becomes the new current range (defined by a **low** and a **high** value).\n    * The final encoded output is any single floating-point number within the final, narrow range.\n3.  **Advantage:** Because the code can represent non-integer bit lengths, it is highly efficient, particularly for sources with a small number of symbols or highly skewed probability distributions, which is common in image data after a lossy compression step (like DCT).",

      "answer": "Image compression aims to reduce the amount of data required to represent an image by removing **redundant data**. Redundancy is the unnecessary duplication or presence of information. The three main types of redundancy in digital images are:\n\n## 1. ⚛️ Coding Redundancy\n* **Source:** Occurs when the codes used to represent the pixel values (gray levels) are not optimally assigned based on the frequency of their occurrence.\n* **Explanation:** If a symbol (gray level) with a high probability of occurrence is assigned a long codeword, the overall bit rate is unnecessarily high. Optimal coding assigns shorter codes to more frequent symbols (e.g., Huffman coding, Arithmetic coding).\n* **Removal Method:** **Variable-length coding** (e.g., Huffman coding, Run-Length Encoding).\n\n## 2. 🗺️ Interpixel Redundancy (Spatial Redundancy)\n* **Source:** Occurs due to the **strong correlation** between adjacent pixels. In typical images, a pixel's value is very similar to its neighbors.\n* **Explanation:** The information carried by a pixel is largely predictable from its neighbors. Therefore, transmitting the value of every pixel is redundant; only the **difference** between adjacent pixels (which is usually a small number) needs to be transmitted.\n* **Removal Method:** **Predictive coding** (e.g., Differential Pulse Code Modulation - DPCM) or **Transform coding** (e.g., Discrete Cosine Transform - DCT, which de-correlates the image data).\n\n## 3. 👁️ Psychovisual Redundancy\n* **Source:** Occurs because certain information is **irrelevant to the human visual system (HVS)** or is present in a form that the HVS cannot perceive.\n* **Explanation:** The HVS has limitations (e.g., it is less sensitive to high-frequency color variations than to high-frequency luminance variations, and it cannot perceive very small differences in intensity). Information that is visually insignificant can be safely removed without a noticeable degradation in perceived image quality.\n* **Removal Method:** **Quantization** (lossy compression). This is achieved by reducing the number of gray levels or color shades (e.g., by sacrificing LSB planes or coarsely quantizing transform coefficients).",

      "answer": "## 💣 Impulse Noise Model\n**Impulse noise** (also known as **salt-and-pepper noise** or **spike noise**) is a noise model that appears as random, isolated pixels of extreme intensity scattered across an image. It is often caused by sudden, short-duration electrical disturbances during image acquisition or transmission (e.g., faulty sensors, memory errors).\n\n1.  **Characteristics:**\n    * The noise is characterized by abrupt, large, and **random intensity changes** at a few scattered pixel locations.\n    * **Salt:** Pixels taking the **maximum** possible value (e.g., 255 for 8-bit image, appearing white).\n    * **Pepper:** Pixels taking the **minimum** possible value (e.g., 0 for 8-bit image, appearing black).\n\n2.  **Mathematical Model:** The noise is typically modeled as a **bipolar impulse model** or simply as a random variable with a probability $P$ of having an impulsive value.\n    Let $p_a$ be the probability of a black impulse (pepper) and $p_b$ be the probability of a white impulse (salt). The probability that a pixel is affected is $P = p_a + p_b$. The probability of a pixel being noise-free is $1-P$.\n    * The model assumes that the noisy pixels are **independent** of the signal and of each other.\n\n3.  **Noise Density:** The percentage of pixels corrupted by impulse noise (often $P < 0.1$, or 10%) is called the **noise density**. The effectiveness of filters like the Median filter depends on the density being low.",

Colors are formed by adding components of light.\n* **Principle:** When R, G, and B light components are combined in varying proportions, they produce a wide spectrum of colors.\n    * **Maximum intensity (1, 1, 1):** Produces **White** (since all three colors of light are added).\n    * **Minimum intensity (0, 0, 0):** Produces **Black** (the absence of light).\n* **Application:** All color-producing electronic display devices (monitors, TVs, digital cameras).\n* **Representation:** Represented as a cube where the origin $(0, 0, 0)$ is black and the point $(1, 1, 1)$ is white.\n\n## 2. 🖨️ CMY (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) Model\n* **Type:** **Subtractive** color model. Colors are formed by subtracting (absorbing) components of white light.\n* **Principle:** The CMY colors are the **secondary colors** of the RGB model. Each CMY pigment absorbs one of the primary RGB colors and reflects the other two.\n    * **Maximum concentration (1, 1, 1):** Ideally produces **Black** (since all light is absorbed). In practice, a $K$ (Black) component is often added to form CMYK for true black.\n    * **Minimum concentration (0, 0, 0):** Produces **White** (since no pigment is present to absorb any light, reflecting all white light).\n* **Application:** Color printing and graphic arts (e.g., inkjet and laser printers).\n\n## 🔄 Conversion (Ideal)\nCMY and RGB are complementary. The transformation between them (assuming normalized values in $[0, 1]$) is:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} C \\\\ M \\\\ Y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} R \\\\ G \\\\ B \\end{pmatrix}$$",
